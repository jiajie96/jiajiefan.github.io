title: "Enhancing Plausibility Evaluation for Generated Designs with Denoising Autoencoder"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/fdd
excerpt: "In this work, we propose to encode the to-be-evaluated images with a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) and measure the distribution distance in the resulting latent space. Hereby, we design a novel metric Fréchet Denoised Distance (FDD)."
